# Advent of Code 2019

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019/about) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

This repo is my attempt to solve as many problems as possible, all written in TypeScript.
